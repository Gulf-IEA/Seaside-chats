**GOALS:**

Foster a collaborative environment where everyone in the IEA can join other projects
Space for learning and sharing tools, code, etc.
Do our IEA work more collaboratively, and automate where we can so that new members can easily join projects
A space for us to define our best practices for coding, data management, project workflow, and publishing 

**Recommending a topic for future seaside chats:**

To suggest a topic for a future seaside chat, go to the issues tab, and create a new issue with a brief description of what you want to cover and maybe a date(s) that would work best for you.
