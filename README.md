Repository for resources and other information from our seaside chat meetings

GOALS:

Foster a collaborative environment where everyone in the IEA can join other projects
Space for learning and sharing tools, code, etc.
Do our IEA work more collaboratively, and automate where we can so that new members can easily join projects
A space for us to define our best practices for coding, data management, project workflow, and publishing
